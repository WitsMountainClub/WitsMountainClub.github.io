        <h1>Formal 2019</h1>
        <p style="text-align: right">
            By William Young, <time datetime="2020-05-03T00:00+02:00">3rd of May 2020</time>
        </p>
        <p>
            I never could have seen myself as a climber when I was younger… A poor display of upper body strength, being
            scared of heights and a lack of ability to face my fears was not the combination I thought would make up a
            rock climber.
        </p>
        <p>
            However after being persuaded by my friend Antonio (who had himself caught the climbing bug not too long
            before), the time finally came for me to attempt to ascend my first ever climb at the ripe old age of 22.
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting to the top of the climb flexing my incredible array of attributes Antonio began to lower me to
            the ground. Clutching on the rope white knuckled and shaking like a leaf with adrenalin my feet finally
            found the safety of the floor… but all that I wanted at this point was to do it again.
        </p>
        <p>
            I must say however that I didn’t know then that I would get as hooked on climbing as I did. It was Formal
            2019 that really changed my fate.
        </p>
        <p>
            I sadly couldn’t make the Saturday as I had a friend’s wedding but I refused to miss out on all the fun that
            was to be had on this week. So Sunday morning began at 6am. Still slightly drunk and reeking of alcohol, I
            stumble onto a crowded Intercape bus receiving a noticeable amount of stares from my fellow passengers - but
            determined to get to Swinburne, and climb Long Bolt, I put my head down and tried to sleep through the
            gruesome 3 hour bus ride.
        </p>
        <p>
            Long Bolt is still to this day the most incredible experience of my life but I am certain that there will be
            at least one article in here discussing it so I’m going to share another experience which was in itself just
            as unforgettable.
        </p>
        <p>
            After receiving my fines for being dumb during the few months that I had been a member of the club, (the
            first of which was for missing the Formal Party) a bunch of us stayed up until 11:30 talking until Antonio
            expressed his desire to go night climbing in order to try and send this 23 that he had heard so much about.
        </p>
        <p>
            Expecting a firm no, he smiled. But his smile was met with a firm silence. Eyes darted around the room until
            Rhys says “so is this happening???”
        </p>
        <p>
            We quickly ran to gather gear (giggling like 6 year olds) and to wake up Jemma and Petzl to join our new
            adventure. We all piled into the Land Rover, Antonio on the front and myself on the back all bouncing with
            excitement with Rhys’ German Hype music blaring in the speakers to get us in the “Sending Mood”.
        </p>
        <p>
            We arrive at the wall, positioned the car lights just right so we can see what we’re doing and get ready to
            SEND.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standing in the billowing wind, shivering my ass off while waiting for my turn and running up and down a
            hill to warm up for the climb was again not what I expected to be the formula for one of the most memorable
            experiences of my life, but something about being spat off that wall with my new found friends while a star
            silhouetted Long Bolt towered over us is something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was after this trip that the climbing bug truly bit me. Climbing has brought into my life, some of my
            closest friends and best experiences. I only wish I had started earlier in my life but intend to make up for
            the lost time - and hope that this article helps get you to give it a try and share these amazing
            experiences with the whole of the Wits Mountain Club.
